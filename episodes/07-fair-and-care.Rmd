## Introduction

FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Re-usable) principles are designed to make research data more discoverable, both by humans and machines. FAIR principles can be applied to digital data from any discipline.

CARE (Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics) principles are people and purpose-oriented and reflect the role of data in advancing indigenous innovation and self-determination. Throughout this section, we will go into detail about FAIR and CARE and provide some practical steps to apply these principles to your research data.

This episode should be pretty straightforward. There may be questions around the practical implementations. CARE may only apply to certain types of research data, but it's important for the researchers to be aware that these exist.

## Why use FAIR principles
FAIR principles are headed by the [GO FAIR Initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) and stand for

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**e-usable

### Benefits of FAIR
Working towards making research data more FAIR provides many benefits including:

- increasing the visibility and citations of your research
- improving the reproducibility and reliability of your research
- enabling  new innovative research approaches and tools
- aligning with international standards and approaches

## How do you make your research more FAIR
### Findable
To make research data findable, publish the data (or a metadata-only record) with as much research metadata as possible. Most research data publishing platforms provide you with a persistent identifier, such as a [Digital Object Identifier](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/), which you can use to cite or share you work.

### Accessible
To make your research data more accessible, ensure it can be downloaded over the internet from the publishing platform it is hosted on. As with the previous episode, this involves data with the proper "rawness" in order to reproduce results and the repository size should be as small as possible to facilitate download and storage. Consider using a publishing platform that supports API (Application Programming Interface) access to make it easier for machines and databases to harvest the research data or it's metadata.

### Interoperable
To make research data interoperable, use community-accepted languages, [formats](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/community-endorsed-data-standards/), and [vocabularies](https://ardc.edu.au/resource/vocabularies-and-research-data-2/) in the data and metadata. Metadata should reference and describe relationships to other data, metadata, and information through the use of [identifiers](https://ardc.edu.au/resources/working-with-data/citation-identifiers/).

### Re-usable
To make research data reusable, it should come with a clear human and machine-readable license and [provenance](https://rd-alliance.org/groups/research-data-provenance.html) information on how it was collected and generated. It should also abide by discipline-specific data and metadata standards where possible, to ensure it retains important context. The Data Management Plan, README file, and Dataset README file are all parts of making your data reusable.

## Making data FAIR
Thinking about your research data. What are some easy practical steps to make your data FAIR?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

- publish your research data in a publicly accessible repository when possible
- mint a persistent identifier for your research data
- use community accepted language in data and metadata
- specify the license and provenance for your research data.
- include metadata and README files.

## Why use CARE?
CARE principles are developed by the [Global Indigenous Data Alliance](https://www.gida-global.org/) stands for

- **C**ollective benefit
- **A**uthority of control
- **R**esponsibility
- **E**thics

CARE principles are meant to complement FAIR principles by encouraging the centering of both people and purpose in the sharing of research data. CARE principles were developed because FAIR principles focus on increased data sharing while ignoring Indigenous Data sovereignty or historical contexts around research data pertaining to Indigenous Peoples. This creates a tension for Indigenous peoples who are asserting greater control over the use and application of their data[^1].

### Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSoV) and Governance (IDGov) Initiatives
Indigenous Data Sovereignty (IDSov) revolves around Indigenous Peoples' rights to govern the creation, collection, ownership, and application of the data about, from, or connected to Intellectual Property[^2]. 

The United Nations supports Indigenous rights over their data as outlined in the United Nations Declarations on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples[^3]. 

The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Indigenous Data Working Group has put out a recommended practice for provenence of Indigenous Peoples Data. The Recommended Practice for the Provenance of Indigenous Peoples' Data establishes a common set of parameters for the provenance of Indigenous Peoples' data. This Recommended Practice supports appropriate disclosure of Indigenous Peoples' relationships and/or links to all data. Provenance of Indigenous Peoples' Data includes information that facilitates Indigenous Peoples' governance, decision-making, participation, collaboration, and engagement in and for current and future uses of Indigenous Peoples' data[^4].

## Practical Information on Practicing CARE Principles
The Indigenous Data Governance and Universities Communiqué[^5] offers resources to assist practicing IDSov. The following are some country specific data from the Communiqué.

### Indigenous Metadata Bundle
Indigenous metadata provides critical organisation and structure for Indigenous Peoples’ data to be FAIR and with proper attribution, which enables governance, decision-making, and cultural 
authority by Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous metadata guides the inclusion of cultural context, data protection, and 
ownership for Indigenous rights holders. This helps recognize, refine, and define Indigenous Peoples’ relationships 
with their data. The metadata bundle is available for download here: [https://indigenousdatalab.org/3006-2/](https://indigenousdatalab.org/3006-2/)

### Māori Data Governance Model
The Māori Data Governance Model is designed by Māori data experts for use across the Aotearoa (New Zealand) 
public service. Māori data is a taonga[^6] that requires culturally grounded models of protection and care. The Model 
provides guidance for the system-wide governance of Māori data, consistent with the Government’s responsibilities 
under te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Māori Data Governance Model can be found here: [https://www.kahuiraraunga.io/](https://www.kahuiraraunga.io/)

### First Nations Information Governance Committee (FNIGC)
Developer of Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP®) Principles and the First Nations Data 
Governance Strategy (FNDGS). The FNDGS calls for embedding First Nations knowledge and competencies into 
leading-edge information management and information technology at national and regional levels to support First 
Nations as rights holders through improved data stewardship across the data lifecycle. More information can be found on the FNIGC website: [A First Nations Data Governance Strategy](https://fnigc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FNIGC_FNDGS_report_EN_FINAL.pdf)  

### Maiam nayri Wingara
In Australia, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people expect enactment of their IDSov and IDGov principles. 
Universities can assist this process by providing adequate resourcing and support for Indigenous leadership and 
control of Indigenous data at each stage of the data lifecycle. More information on Maiam Nayri Wingara can be found here: [https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/research](https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/research)

## Practical Steps Combining FAIR and CARE

- Publish a description or metadata-only record of research data in a data repository with citable [DOI](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/what-is-a-doi/). This allows others to discover and understand the applicability of the research data. Use a meaningful name (e.g. avoid 'Thesis data'), appropriate metadata, and providing a sample of the data, actual or synthetic.
- Establish and maintain a mediated access process (e.g,. email request or form) linked to the publish description. This process should follow agreed governance processes and ideally, take a people and purpose-oriented approach to granting access.
- Create a data sharing agreement to define and record who the data is shared with, for what purpose, under what conditions (e.g. method of transfer, security requirements) and by whose authority (governance).
- Produce a data availability statement within the publication (e.g. journal article, thesis) linking to the description, possibly referencing the mediated access process and alignment with FAIR and CARE data principles.
