This data Documentation episode based on Chapter 7 of "[The Research Data Management Workbook](https://doi.org/10.7907/z6czh-7zx60)"[^1] by Kristin Briney.

## Introduction

The end of a project is a key time to perform data management activities in
order to set yourself up for future data reuse. This is because you still remember
all of the important details about your data and can make good decisions about
preparing it for the future. This episode has three sections to work through
for project wrap up: a section on converting data to more open file types; a
checklist for populating a project Archive folder; and a checklist for preparing
data for reuse, which leverages the previous episode.

This episode also covers project wrap up in the form of separating from your
institution. This checklist challenge for the departing researcher is important to
work through so that critical data does not get lost in the transition. A fuller
version of this checklist, intended for both the departing personnel and a project
administrator to work through together, is also available[^2].

We will all end up ending our project and having a good plan for your research data ensures it is available for researchers that might take up the project at a later time or use your data for their own research.

## When leaving UC

When leaving UC, your UC account is given an expiration date. It is important to understand what will happen to your data once your UC account is decommissioned.

The following is a basic checklist specific to UC cloud storage:
- Any “corporate” UC data should be moved to appropriate UC storage 
- Data you currently share with UC colleagues and to which they will still need access to after your departure needs to be transferred to them. 
- Remove your personal data

### P-Drive

You will no longer have access to your P-Drive.

### Research Drive

You will no longer be able to access your folders on the Research Drive, but the data will remain for as long as is outlined in the associated DMP.

### OneDrive

Your UC OneDrive will be deleted and all data stored will be gone. You should back up your data to an appropriate storage before leaving the university.

### Dropbox

Similar to OneDrive, your data will be deleted. In the case of Dropbox, you have the option to transfer UC enterprise Dropbox to your personal Dropbox account. If you are leaving UC, you will want to change the email address associated to the account as you will lose access once your UC account is decommissioned. You may be able to directly join your new institution that way if they also offer Dropbox storage.


## Prepare Data for Future Use

This checklist challenge walks you through steps to gather your data into a central place and document the project. Working through the checklist results in project data being in one central location, well documented, and organized and formatted in a way to make future reuse easier.

## Convert Data File Types

Data is often stored in a file type that can only be opened by
specific, costly software – this is referred to as a “proprietary file type.” You can
tell that you have data is in a proprietary file type if you lose access to the data
when you lose access to the software. 

When data is in a proprietary file type, it’s always a good idea to copy the data into a more common, open file type as a backup; you may lose a bit of functionality, but it’s better to have a backup than
to not have your data at all! This challenge works through identifying possible
alternative file types for the data’s proprietary file type before instructing you to
make a copy of the data in the new file type.

## Create an Archive Folder

To save your future-self time spent digging through all of your
research files, set aside the most important files into a separate “Archive” folder.
Do this at the end of the project while you still remember which files are important
and where they are located. The Archive folder should only contain a small subset
of the most important documents that are likely to be reused; you may still need
to go through all of your files but, in the majority of instances, you will save
time by easily finding what you need in the Archive folder.

## Serpate from the Organization

Researchers regularly leave organizations in order to take new jobs.
For how common this occurrence is, it represents a critical transition during
which data may be lost. This checklist enumerates a number of important steps
that researchers can take to ensure that they retain the appropriate data yet
leave behind what belongs to the institution.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- Document your data for future use
- Convert any proprietary data types to more open data types where possible
- Create an archive folder of your most important data that you can take with you
- Make sure you retain copies of the data you have permission to keep when leaving your organization
