This data Documentation episode based on Chapter 5 of "[The Research Data Management Workbook](https://doi.org/10.7907/z6czh-7zx60)"[^1] by Kristin Briney.

## Introduction

While this whole training encompasses data management activities, this section will
introduce you to two useful areas: A living Data Management Plan and the roles and
responsibilities around data management with research collaborators, known as Data
Stewardship.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Emphasize that a DMP is a living document and can be changed at a later time. Also, you don't need to be able to answer all the questions right away, but the important parts are to the person associated with the data, what type of data it is, where it will be stored, and how long to store it.

## Living Data Management Plan (DMP)

Many researchers are aware of the two-page data management
plan (DMP) for a grant application, but you may not be aware of the more useful
type of DMP: a living DMP. This document describes how data will be actively
managed during a project and is called living because it may be updated whenever necessary to reflect
current data practices. A DMP is a useful touchstone for understanding
where data lives, how itâ€™s labelled, how it moves through the research process,
and who will oversee the data management.

For DMPs, UC has partnered with the popular [DMPTool](https://dmptool.org/). This is a free service for researchers that supports SSO sign on by participating organizations. The internet has many resources and videos going over how to use DMPTool. The following link is 13 min. video by [Carnegie Mellon University Libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWdmbXna2xs)
showing DMPTool and how to fill out the forms is provided.

## Determine Data Stewardship

It is often helpful to be up front about requirements and permissions
around research data. This exercise encourages you to discuss these
issues with supervisors and peers to make sure that there are no misunderstandings
about who has what rights to use, retain, and share data.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- A living DMP is useful for understanding where data lives, how it's labelled, how
it moves through the research process, and who will oversee the data management.
- Data stewardship lays out who has what rights to use, retain, and share data.
