## What is Research Data Management (RDM)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: instructor

Requirements for teaching this course:

- post-it cards
- information on the proper storage for research data for your organization
- information about your organization's data management plan system
- Guidance on your countries Indigenous Data Sovereignty models

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

RDM involves practices and choices that simplify the process of finding, comprehending, 
and utilizing research data for you, your collaborators, and your future self. These 
practices encompass the entire data life cycle, from collection and analysis to sharing 
and reuse. Research is hard enough as it is without having to
fight with your files, so the goal of data management is for you to maximize
your time doing research instead of spending extra time with file handling.

Emphasize that proper Research Data Management is a way to make dealing with data
a better experience. It allows for understanding your data even after coming back
to it after a long period of time.

## Why do RDM?
A short YouTube video about a RDM horror story is here: [Research Data Snafu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2zK3sAtr-4)

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

## What went wrong?
What are some key takeaways from the video?

:::::::::::::::::::::::: solution 

- The data only had one copy and was stored on a USB which was in a box somewhere at the Author's house.
- The data was in a format that could only be read by a proprietary program that no longer existed.
- There was no way to reconstruct the data from the labels used because the Author didn't remember what they stood for.
- There was no way to contact the other author to understand what the data labels were so the data was rendered useless.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The benefits of RDM are:

- Understanding of data and its collection methods, even after a year
- Quick and easy retrieval of desired files
- Prevention of data loss, even if your hard drive crashes
- Clarity around the rights and responsibilities you have over your data
- Knowledge of how and where to share your data to comply with your funderâ€™s
data sharing policy
- Ability to pick up and easily reuse data from a past project

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- RDM is really about helping researchers understand their data
- RDM helps researchers keep their data safe and backed up
- RDM helps researchers use their data even after leaving it for a long period
- RDM allows you to more easily share your research data
