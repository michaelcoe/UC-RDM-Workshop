This Project Level README episode based on Chapter 2 of "[The Research Data Management Workbook](https://doi.org/10.7907/z6czh-7zx60)"[^1] by Kristin Briney.

## Introduction

A README file is the starting point for understanding the group of files it accompanies. README files are digital text files in a common format (often .txt or .md, but not exclusively) that provide information about a group of files. README’s are flexible and can be used for anything from describing a whole project (giving a project overview and general file layout) to providing nuanced documentation for a small subset of files. For those using a paper notebook, README’s can supplement written notes by keeping a copy of the documentation alongside physical data.

### Project-Level (PLR) versus Dataset-level (DLR) README.txt

Data files living on a computer often need extra documentation
for someone to understand what research they correspond to. In particular, it
is useful to record the most basic project information and store it in the top level
folder of each research project. The top level README discussed in this episode only 
pertains to the project-level data.

Important here is the fact that both the project and data should be documented in some way.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: callout

A README file is like the instruction manual for assembling furniture. It provides the necessary context and guidance to understand and use the accompanying pieces (digital content). A project can contain multiple datasets, and the data should have it's own associated documentation. Episode 2 gives some possible methods for documenting your data on a dataset level.

## What to include in a PLR

In general, a PLR should include:

- Project description
- Project time period
- Project collaborators
- Storage locations for data, code, and files
- Project documentation methods
- File organization and naming conventions
- Any additional information necessary for understanding the files

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge 

Make sure to download the example README.txt. 
Pick a research project and answer the included questions.

While this episode focused on PLR, it is useful to document the individual datasets. Research Data Documentation Methods[^2] summarizes many documentation methods that can be employed for research data. 

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: keypoints 

- README files are crucial for understanding your data, especially a year later.
- The PLR contains is in the top level folder of the project and contains basic
data about the project.
- Project would have one PLR and documentation for all datasets.
